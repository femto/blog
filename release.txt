                     Scooter Framework Version 1.0.RC3
                            Release Notes



Known Issues in This Release
============================

Running Shared Tomcat on Linux
------------------------------
Auto compiler may not work properly on some linux versions. The workaround is 
to put tools.jar file under webapps/YouApp/WEB-INF/lib/ directory before 
running startup script under the tools/servers/tomcat/bin directory. 


Using table name of mixed case in MySQL on Linux
------------------------------------------------
Scooter's data browser would not work on Linux platform if a table name consists 
of both lowercase and uppercase letters. 
Please refer to the following MySQL document on work around: 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html

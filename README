Dryml
=================

----------
What is it
----------
This is a port from hobo's dryml engine written in java.
It comprises the experience that java's default template solution jsp is not good.
(Other parts is based on scooter framework, scooter is a java framework that resembles rails, please do a google to find out).

The dryml:
when you define a tag:
<dummy>
<def tag="page" attrs='title, full-title'>
(see the source for how page is defined).
</def>
</dummy>

you can call it:

<page>
</page>
or customting a bit:
<page>
<param-content><div style="clear:both">
blah blah blah
</div>
</param-content>
</page>
or customting different parts:
<page>
<param-body>body</param-body>
</page>
(most can be see from hobo's dryml documentation,
only some difference:
I don't use <content:> for parameteration because that's
illegal in xml parsing(I using dom4j for parsing), besides,
the xml document needs a root, so I add a <dummy> node, the root
node can be arbitrary named.

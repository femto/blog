   See "How to configure scooter\tools\servers\tomcat directory" topic below 
   if you prefer to use a different Tomcat release. 

2. This note assumes that you've already installed Tomcat somewhere in your system. 
   
3. In order to run Tomcat properly, you must use conf files from the same Tomcat version.

How to configure scooter/tools/servers/tomcat directory:
========================================================

1. Copy all conf files from apache-tomcat-x.x.x/conf directory to conf/ directory. 

2. Open conf/server.xml file and locate the "appBase" field. 
   The "appBase" field is inside the "Host" tag. 

3. Change appBase="webapps"

   to appBase="{root_path}/webapps"

   {root_path} token will be replaced by the absolute path to your web 
   application during initializtion process. You may manually replace
   {root_path} with the absolute path to your web application too. 

4. Follow instructions above on "How to run shared Tomcat inside scooter/tools/servers".
